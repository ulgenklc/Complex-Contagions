# Complex-Contagions

Complex Contagions is a python library where one can run a simple threshold model(Watts Threshold model) on noisy geometric networks. Then, one can run persistent homology on the distance matrix obtained from the first activation matrix, T(i-->j), with the `gudhi` python package and display the signal propagation patterns as a function of a topological invariant. The complexity of the system may be increased by varying the step function

The spatial distance of nodes are also reflected from the path distance between nodes in geometric networks, the quantification of such patterns via TDA correspond
